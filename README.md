This project is a full-stack AI system for uploading, analyzing, and exploring time series data (like sensor readings or logs) to automatically detect anomalies and understand patterns.

It combines:

Machine learning (Isolation Forest)

Interactive data visualization

AI question-answering on detected anomalies

Features
- Upload Excel or CSV time series files (timestamp + value)

- Automatically detect anomalies using Isolation Forest

- Visualize values and anomalies on an interactive graph

- Display a summary of when, where, and why anomalies were detected

- Ask natural-language questions like:

“Quand a eu lieu la plus grande anomalie ?”

“Combien d’anomalies ont dépassé 50 ?”
